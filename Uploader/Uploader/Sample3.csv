SingleChoice;How many numbers less than 1000 are divisble by 3?;;Every multiple of three is divisible by 3, so divide 1000 by 3 and take the whole part = 333.3333 = 333;;4;300;310;311;333;500;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If a^b = c^d, which of the following is not necessarily true?;;For example, 2^3 = 8^1, but 2 is not equal to 8.;;4;a^b - c^d = 0;a^b + c^d = 2 * (a^b);(a^b)/(c^d) = 1;a = c;a^b * c^d = a^(2*b);;;;;;;
SingleChoice;Which of the following lines does not intersect y = 5 x + 2?;;You are looking for a line whose slope is equal to the slope of the given line, or 5.;;5;-5x + 2y = 4;-2x + 5y = -3;10x - y = 1;3x + y = 17;5x - y = -29;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;A regular polygon has 9 sides. What is the degree measure of the angle, within the polygon, between any two sides?;;First, you must figure the sum of the measures of the internal angles, which is equal to (n-2)180 or (9-2)180 = 7 * 180. Then, you should divide this measure by the number of sides to find the length of each angle. (7 * 180)/9 = 7 * (180/9) = 7 * 20 = 140 degrees;;4;60;90;120;140;165;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;A cubic box, X, has sides of length n. Another cubic box, Y, has sides of length 2n. How many boxes X could fit into a single box Y?;;The volume of Y is equal to (2n)^3 = 8n^3. The volume of X is equal to n^3. So, to find the number of X's that could fit into Y, you should divide the volume of Y by that of X, or 8n^3/n^3, which is equal to 8.;;3;2;4;8;16;32;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;"A number is called ""round"" if it contains at least one zero as a digit. How many three-digit numbers are ""round?""";;"An easy strategy here is to just count the number of ""round"" numbers between 100 and 199 and multiply that number by 9 for every hundreds digit (100, 200, 300... to 900). So, there are 19 ""round"" numbers through 100-199 (100, 101, 102 ... 109 = 10 + and 110, 120, 130... 190 = 9). 19 * 9 = 171";;2;153;171;178;179;215;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;How many ways can Pete, Mary, Sue, and Joe stand in a line if Joe and Sue cannot stand next to each other?;;The strategy here is to count: Number of ways = Total number of ways that PMSJ can stand together - Number of ways that SJ stand next to eachother. The total number of ways that PMSJ can stand next to each other is equal to 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24. The number of ways that SJ will end up standing next to eachother is 6: (SJPM, PSJM, PMSJ, JSPM, PJSM, PMJS). So, 24 - 6 = 18 ways.;;5;4;6;12;16;18;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;A square, X, has sides of length n. Another square, Y, has sides of length 1.5n. How many X can fit into a single Y?;;The number of X's that fit into Y is equal to the ratio of area of Y to that of X. Area of Y = (1.5n)^2 = 2.25. The area of X = n^2. 2.25n^2/n^2 = 2.25;;4;1;42491;2;45689;4;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;A triangle has sides of length 7, 11, and X. Which of the following cannot be X?;;The sum of lengths of two sides of a triangle cannot be less than the length of the third side. So, 2 + 7 = 9, but 9 < 11;;1;2;4;8;12;18;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If |a| < |b|, and a > b, which of the following is necessarily true?;;Because the absolute value of a is less than that of b, a is a lesser magnitude than b. However, a > b, so a must be a positive number and b a negative number. So, you can plug in numbers: a = some positive number of magnitude less than b, or a = 3, b = -10. Plug them in, and only B works out.;;2;|a + b| > |b| + |a|;|a + b| < a - b;|a| + |b| > 2|b|;|a - b| > a + b;|a| - |b| > |a - b|;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;Six children sit at a circular table. In how many orders can they sit at the table?;;At a circular (ring) table, the order ABCDEF = BCDEFA = CDEFAB, and so on. So, you need to find the total number of orders and divide this number by 6 to recognize the fact that the table is circular. The total number of orders is 6!, and 6!/6 = 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.;;5;6;18;64;118;120;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If a two-sided coin is flipped three times, what is the probability that at least one head will show up?;;The probability of one head showing up is equal to 1 - P(All tails), and the probability of all tails is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, so 1- 1/8 = 7/8;;5;1/8;3/8;1/2;2/3;7/8;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If m & n = (m + n)^(m - n), what is 2 & (2 & 2)?;;First, do what is in the ( )'s. (2 & 2) = (2 + 2) ^ ( 2 - 2) = 4^0 = 1. Next, plug in 1 for (2 & 2) to get 2 & 1 = (2 + 1)^(2 - 1) = 3^1 = 3.;;2;2;3/8;4;6;8;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;Which of the following cannot be formed from any combination of two pennies, three nickles, one dime, and two quarters?;;You cannot create four cents with three pennies.;;2;$0.03;$0.54;$0.56;$0.75;$0.78;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;"A three-digit number is called ""big"" if any two of its digits are equal. How many three-digit numbers are ""big?""";;Start with 100-199 and then multiply the result by 9 for each hundreds digit. 100, 101, 110, 111, 112, 113, ... 119, 121, 122, 131, 133, 141, 144, 151, 155... = 2 + 10 + 2(8) = 12 + 16 = 28. 28 * 9 = 252;;4;112;146;214;252;316;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If 2 ^ (4x + 3) = 4 ^ (x - 1), what is x?;;If a ^ b = a ^ c, then b = c. However, 2 does not equal 4, so we should make the two equal. 4 = 2 ^ 2, so 4 ^ (x - 1) = (2 ^ 2) ^ (x - 1) = 2 ^ 2(x-1) by exponent rules. So since 2 = 2, 4x + 3 = 2(x-1) -> 4x + 3 = 2x - 2 -> 2x = - 5 -> x = -5/2;;2;-3;-2,5;-1;2;0;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;Which of the following values of x is not in the domain of the function y = x / (x^2-2x+1);;Any time the denominator is equal to 0, that value of x is not included in the functional value. So, x / (x^2-2x+1) = x / (x-1)^2. (x-1)^2 = 0 only when x = 1.;;5;-3;-2;-1;0;1;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If a + b = y, what is a^2 + 2ab + b^2?;;a^2+2ab+b^2 = (a+b)^2 = y^2;;3;y;2y;y^2;2y^2;4y^2;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;The number 100 has two trailing zeros. How many trailing zeros does 100! have?;;Every trailing zero indicates a factor of 10 or 5 * 2. Since there are many more factors of 2 than 5's, you should count the number of factors of 5 there are in 100! Since it is one big product (100 * 99 * 98...), count: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 (5 * 5), 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 (5*5), 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 (5*5), 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 (5*5). The total number of 5's is 24.;;4;12;15;18;24;28;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;Which of the following statements is always true?;;Since |X + Y| is always less than or equal to |X| + |Y|, substitute a^2 for X and b^2 for Y to find |a^2 + b^2| is less than or equal to |a^2| + |b^2|;;4;|(a+b)^2| < |a^2| + |b^2|;|a^2 + b^2| > (a+b)^2;|a^2 + b^2| >= |a+b|^2;|a^2 + b^2 - 1|;|a + b^2| > |a^2 - b|;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;In physics, force = mass * acceleration. Suppose you have an original force F and new force G in which the mass is increased by a factor of two and the acceleration is increased by a factor of four. What is the ratio of G:F?;;"F = ma, G = (2m)(4a) = 8ma; 8ma:ma simplifies to 8:1";;5;1:8;1:4;1:1;4:1;8:1;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If a^2 = b^2, which of the following is/are always true? I. a = b II. |a| = |b| III. |a - b| = 0;;If a^2 = b^2, then a = + or - b.;;2;I only;II only;I and II;I and III;I, II, and III;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If two lines have a slopes of -4 and 1/4, which of the following is true about the two lines?;;A line is perpendicular to another if each of the slopes are the negative reciprocals of each other. -4 is the negative reciprocal of 1/4, so they are perpendicular and therefore intersect at 90 degree angles.;;4;They do not intersect;They intersect at two points;They are parallel;The angle formed between their intersection is 90 degrees in measure;They are the same line;;;;;;;
SingleChoice;If (a-b)^2 = (a+b)^2, what is the value of ab?;;;;3;-4;-2;0;2;4;;;;;;;
